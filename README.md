- Create class Machine containing methods `public abstract void doWork()` and `public abstract void stopWork()`.  
- Create classes `machines.Truck`, `machines.Bulldozer`, `machines.Excavator` that will inherit from `Machine`.
- In those classes override `doWork()`, so it will print message that certain machine started its work.
- Override `stopWork()` as well. It should print messages that certain machine stopped its work.
- In `Main` class create `Machine` array with `machines.Truck`, `machines.Bulldozer` and `machines.Excavator` and call methods `doWork()` and `stopWork()` in a loop.
